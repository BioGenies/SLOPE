\arguments{
\item{A}{an \eqn{n}-by-\eqn{p} matrix}

\item{b}{vector of length \eqn{n}}

\item{lambda}{vector of length \eqn{p}, sorted in decreasing order}

\item{max_iter}{maximum number of iterations in the gradient descent}

\item{grad_iter}{number of iterations between gradient updates}

\item{tol_infeas}{tolerance for infeasibility}

\item{tol_rel_gap}{tolerance for relative gap between primal and dual
problems}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{SLOPE_solver.result}. This object is a list
containing at least the following components:
\item{x}{solution vector \eqn{x}}
\item{optimal}{logical: whether the solution is optimal}
\item{iter}{number of iterations}
}

\details{
This optimization problem is convex and is solved using an
accelerated proximal gradient descent method.
